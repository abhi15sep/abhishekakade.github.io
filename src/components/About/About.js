Hello! I'm Abhishek, a Front End Developer based in Karad, Maharashtra who enjoys building stuff with JavaScript and React. I develop responsive websites and web apps that are optimized to run fast on any and all devices.

Computers have always fascinated me. I'm a dentist but I first dabbled into web development out of interest in web, the Internet and then Computer Science. I started reading about web development in my final year in dentistry and then started learning web development in internship from resources like freeCodeCamp, YouTube, MDN, Reddit, Medium, etc. Then it became something more than just interest. It became my passion. Around that time, I got to know about Google India Scholarship. I applied, worked hard and got selected in the top 350 out of 10k applicants in India to receive Google-Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree. I successfully graduated from the Front-End Nanodegree and started learning more on my own.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently and the skills I've picked up so far:
